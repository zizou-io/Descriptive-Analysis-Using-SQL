## FIFA 19 Data Analysis

### Overview
In this project, I analyzed a FIFA 19 dataset using SQL to gain insights into the players, clubs, and nationalities represented in the game. The dataset contains information such as player attributes, club details, and nationality.

### Data Cleaning
I began by checking for missing values and updating them to ensure the data was complete and accurate. I also performed basic cleaning operations such as removing duplicates and correcting data types.

### Exploratory Analysis
I conducted an exploratory analysis to understand the basic statistics of the dataset. This included calculating the total number of players, the number of nationalities represented, and the distribution of players based on their preferred foot.

### Player Analysis
I analyzed various aspects of the players, including their wages, overall ratings, and jersey numbers. I identified the player with the highest and lowest wages, as well as the player with the best and worst overall ratings. Additionally, I examined the distribution of players based on their preferred foot and the luckiest jersey number.

### Club Analysis
I analyzed clubs based on their total and average overall ratings. I identified the clubs with the highest total and average ratings, as well as the top clubs based on the average ratings of their players.

### Nationality Analysis
I examined the distribution of players based on their nationality. I identified the nationality with the highest number of players and the top three nationalities by the number of players represented.

### Joining Dates Analysis
I analyzed the number of players who joined their respective clubs within a specific date range and date-wise. I also examined the yearly distribution of players who joined their clubs.

### Conclusion
This project provided valuable insights into the FIFA 19 dataset, helping us understand the demographics of players, clubs, and nationalities represented in the game. These insights can be used to inform game development decisions and enhance the gaming experience for players.
